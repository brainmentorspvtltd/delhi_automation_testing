What is Constructor?
Constructor is called when u create a new object. So It will initialise the value during object creation.
By default we have default constructor , it does nothing it is empty
We can create Param Constructor for Parameter passing
Constructor name is same as class name
Constructor never return any value even it not void
In one class we have n constructor , Constructor overloading
Constructor Chaining - One constructor is calling another constructor i.e this()
