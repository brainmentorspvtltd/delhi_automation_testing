Find the Leader Element in an Array
Write a program to print all the LEADERS in the array. An element is leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side. And the rightmost element is always a leader. For example int the array {300,40,60,90,100,12,16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, leaders are 300,100,17, 5 and 2.




Problem 3 Find the Missing Number
You are given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in the list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8} Output: 5
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 5} Output: 4
